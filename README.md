## Description

This repository contains a collection of Jupiter notebooks and code exercises I worked on during the IBM Introduction to Data Science Specialization.
Each folder corresponds to a different course within the program and covers various topics and concepts related to data science and its applications.
Each course focuses on specific aspects of data science, such as data analysis, data visualization, machine learning, and more.


## Course Content

The IBM Introduction to Data Science Specialization is a comprehensive program consisting of several courses, including:

### Course 1: What is Data Science?

-   ##### Description:  
Data Science has gained the label of being the sexiest profession of the 21st century due to its ability to uncover insights and trends in data, enabling data-driven conclusions and predictions. This introductory course provides a comprehensive understanding of Data Science, including concepts like Machine Learning and Neural Networks, and showcases real-world data science applications in business.

### Course 2: Tools for Data Science

-  ##### Description:
This course focuses on equipping you with the essential tools utilized by Data Science professionals. You will gain proficiency in using popular tools such as Jupyter Notebooks, JupyterLab, RStudio IDE, Git, GitHub, and Watson Studio. Through hands-on experience in a cloud-based environment, you'll learn to work with these tools, including executing code in Python, R, or Scala. The course culminates with a final project where you'll demonstrate your skills by creating a Jupyter Notebook, utilizing Markdown, and sharing your work with peers.

### Course 3: Data Science Methodology

-  ##### Description:
This repository contains the code and resources for the Data Science Methodology Course. The course teaches you the major steps involved in practicing data science, using the CRISP-DM methodology. You will learn how to form a business/research problem, collect, prepare & analyze data, build a model, deploy a model and understand the importance of feedback. The Data Science Methodology Course teaches you how to think and work like a successful data scientist. You will learn the major steps involved in practicing data science, using the CRISP-DM methodology. The course covers the following topics:
  * Problem Formulation: How to define a business/research problem that can be solved using data science.
  * Data Collection: How to collect data from a variety of sources.
  * Data Preparation: How to clean, format, and transform   data so that it is ready for analysis.
  * Data Analysis: How to use statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze data.
  * Model Building: How to build and evaluate predictive models.
  * Model Deployment: How to deploy models into production.
  * Feedback: How to use feedback to improve your data science skills.

### Course 4: Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python

-   ##### Description:
This course will teach you the fundamentals of SQL, a powerful language used for communicating with and extracting data from databases. You will learn how to write foundational SQL statements, filter result sets, use WHERE, COUNT, DISTINCT, and LIMIT clauses, differentiate between DML & DDL, CREATE, ALTER, DROP and load tables, use string patterns and ranges; ORDER and GROUP result sets, and built-in database functions. You will also learn how to build sub-queries and query data from multiple tables, access databases as a data scientist using Jupyter notebooks with SQL and Python, and work with advanced concepts like Stored Procedures, Views, ACID Transactions, Inner & Outer JOINs.

 Through hands-on labs and projects, you will practice building SQL queries, work with real databases on the cloud, and use real data science tools. In the final project, you will analyze multiple real-world datasets to demonstrate your skills.
